This is my first project in Python. It sends bulk mail from any SMTP server to the receiver

I write it since 2011-01-20 during a 5 days holiday.

PSEUDO CODE
========
* provide the info of email sender
* read the contact list
* read the template of email content
* construct an email
* connect to email server (SMTP, maybe over SSL)
* send out email to the receivers via the SMTP server
